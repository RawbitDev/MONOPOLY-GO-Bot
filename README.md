# MONOPOLY-GO-Bot
Simple Python Auto-Clicker for MONOPOLY GO! or similar Games using BlueStacks.

## How it works
Simply place images of the buttons to cklick in the `buttons` folder.  
As soon as one of the images is found on screen, the bot automatically clicks the center of it.  
If several buttons are found at the same time, one is selected at random.

## Setup
1. Move to the project folder.
2. Install dependencies using:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run script:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
